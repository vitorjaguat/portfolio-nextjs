This application supports user authentication using firebase. Users are able to create a new account using their email address and can then sign in to save coins to a user specific list. This is made possble by creating a firestore cloud storage database at the time of user registration. Another feature of this application is dynamic routing through the \"React Router DOM\" package. This application was built using the Coin Gecko API.",
